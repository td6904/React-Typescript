Deleted then recloned so probably have to run npm something. Checkout video!

First React tutorial I did that also uses Typescript - I had a problem noted below and couldn't get it to work for the rest of the tutorial. I think it may be the way my machine is setup. So I left this to the side and worked on React with Typescript. I will come back to this when I understand the ins and outs of React better.

At around 50m, passing data via props.

Never have to touch node_modules! Just packages!

Ending up getting an ### error ###

"Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "application/octet-stream". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec."

I had started it a few days prior and everything was working fine - I got to around 50m, the start of the Props chapter. As soon as I loaded up my laptop this morning and tried looking at the list, nothing shows up, only this error in the console. I tried it in a different browser and still got the same response.
